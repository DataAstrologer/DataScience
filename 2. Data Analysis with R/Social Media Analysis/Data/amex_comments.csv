"21","1116072775108416","Vipin RG","Dear Amex Team,
I wanted to just bring in to your kind notice about the sad customer handling technique of your team based in Chennai and Coimbatore. I was approached three times by your team member for a card, twice rejected due to some not so convincing reason. i was approached again, this time the total time taken to process the entire document was 1 month and after that no replies from the team. No reference number shared, no follow up..nothing. Only i have been following up. Finally when i spoke to a colleague of yours in Gurgaon , she noted down the entire details and registered a complain. Within 10 minutes i got a call saying that my application has been rejected. Well i am not surprised this is happening for the third time... With this type of response and customer handling i am sorry the brand which is highly reputed is been brought down.
Another unconvincing reply and more over its like an insult.
I would request you to please look into the same, at least other clients of yours should not be treated, just forgot to tell you, after the call the gentleman tried to play the blame game tooooo
i m not very happy about this incident.","2016-10-08T09:36:34+0000",0,"1277762498909819_1279302972089105","168312979854782_1277762498909819"
"22","10210947179179919","Manish Rathod","Hi ,

This is to bring to your notice that I had applied for the AmEx platinum card during the month of August 2016. I received a confirmation mail from Mr. Manoj Adlakha on August 7th that the card has been approved and dispatched. 
This is where my trouble starts- I received a SMS from Blue-Dart that shipment #33602104594 will be delivered shortly. I called up customer care and opted for an earlier delivery as i was about to travel. They promised to deliver but did not. 
I was back in Bangalore on 12th August and contacted Blue-Dart for the delivery. On two occasions the deliver was scheduled but the card was not delivered. Then i made an effort to contact the Blue-Dart delivery guy Mr. Vijay , Mobile # 9341925062. He promised to deliver shortly and did not turn up.
I even contacted Mr. Amit Kumar Singh of American Express, mail Id- amit.k.singh@aexp.com, Mobile No- 8105158147 and voiced my concern. I reached out to him because he had signed me up for the card. 
Again No action !!! Irony is i receive a communication from American Express by letter asking for a feedback as to why i have not received the card !! I mean seriously, after putting in so much of efforts, you ask me that question ????  

I had decided that if this is the kind of service AM-EX provides, let me stay away from it, but looks like you guys love to haunt people. I have started receiving an automated call daily since a week now asking me call up some customer care number. I ignored it initially but when i received an SMS from Am-Ex to pay up Rs. 5315.58 by 23rd Oct, i decided to call up the customer service anyways. I politely asked them to stop calling me and send out a communication for no dues( i am sure you guys will have a recording of the call )   
The customer care apologized and said it will be taken care. But the automated call continues to haunt me. So finally i have decided to write this lengthy e-mail wasting my time and also yours !!! 
Please help me understand why as a customer i should-
1. Follow -up for the delivery of the card with the courier company.
2. Follow -up for the delivery of the card with Am-Ex relationship manager.
3.Be asked to pay-up for services that i have not utilized.
4.Harassed with automated calls 
5. Waste my precious time following up and writing such lengthy e-mails
Requesting you to sort my problem immediately and send a communication for NO DUES from my side asap.

Regards
Manish Rathod

"23","10154748616453945","Anshuman Bhandari","I recently purchased Platinum card and was excited about it but seems like I got defrauded by the AMEX sales person @ Mumbai Airport. The one primary benefit for which I took the card was NO FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE. The sales person also said that I will receive airline vouchers worth Rs 17,500 also. After receiving the card, I called up the customer support since I didn't see any vouchers in my package and in card agreement there was no mention of foreign transaction fee. To my surprise they said there are no such benefits at all and they cannot do anything about it. Either the sales person was lying or the customer support was not updated on the offers they are running in field. I have been an AMEX customer since 2011 and feel disappointed by the whole event and rethinking my partnership with AMEX.","2016-10-08T08:48:33+0000",0,"1277762498909819_1279265058759563","168312979854782_1277762498909819"

"29","1563248520367815","Nitin Harne","Hi Folks, 
I am a member of amex for last 4 hour and maintaining a decent credit history. A month back my office( COGNIZANT) gave me a official credit card. At that time they also suggested me to upgrade my Gold to Platinum for various benefits. 

Based on their suggestion  i spoke to AMEX call center and got a confirmation that its possible to transfer all reward points and suggested me to make a new application for platinum card.  I got a double confirmation on next day too. 

after receiving the platinum card in last week,i called up call center to transfer and they agreed to do it. 

when i called yesterday to confirm it whether its transferred, to my shock i was told that its not possible and he promised me to arrange a call with manager. 

Just now manager called and infored that its no possible (spoiling my weekend) . He is recommending me to continue using GOLD card or encash all points. I dont intend to carry two cards and nor forcefully wants to use all these points by taking some unnecessary vouchers. i would have rather preferred a GIFT card(which according to him not possible). 

i know there may be some limitations on your part but for me its a shock and waste of time dealing with your call center folks. 

appreciate if you can look in to the matter and close in next week. 

its Diwali time, but i will NOT use AMEX till the time this issue is resolved or my payment date of next 7th. ....hope its not a last payment transaction with AMEX for my personal card.  I am not keen on dealing with your organisation anymore if this is the level of service.

 Off course this feedback will be shared with my corporate team too as they suggested me this. 

Regards
Nitin

"52","10157547174550702","Tarun Revoo","In January i purchased two bicycles and tried to make a payment through American Express. There was some problem in the machine and it declined thrice. After that i made the same payment through my Citibank card. In between these two transactions. My son decided that he wanted to change the cycle, so there was discrepancy between the two amounts swiped but that was mentioned in the bill.

Now when i got my American Express statement, the charge was reflecting not once but thrice. I called up the Amex service centre and was told to submit proof. Which i did. Statement from my Citibank credit card and the receipt that was issued by the vendor. I went to the vendor as well and was told that it would be sorted out. 

They put this transaction in dispute and gave me a temporary credit. Now in March, they credited my account with two transactions and decide to charge me for the third. I called them up again and was told to submit the proof again. Which i did again. 

So cut a long story short. In July i got a letter from Amex that they have appointed some external agency to recover this money. I called Amex again, i have been in touch with them ever since and was told that they would put it into dispute again and was told to submit the proof again. 

So i did but still there is no solution to this problem. They have put this transaction in dispute but they are now asking me to pay interest that they levied on this disputed transaction.

The only problem is that i am not in the country and don't know when or how will i be able to resolve this?","2016-09-21T08:41:46+0000",1,"1263081727044563_1264002643619138","168312979854782_1263081727044563"

i. I had called AMEX on 9 or 10th July, informing about expected delay in processing payment at my corporate. The AMEX executive said that AMEX is giving a grace period till 30th July (atleast I heard it as 30th). So entire late payment charges of Rs. 10,000 + taxes was a surprise for me.

ii. I called up AMEX again on 30th July giving above context. The executive reversed late payment charges of 6000 + taxes and mentioned waiver for the remaining amount would be subject to management review. She committed I will receive a callback if the amount is not reversed. But I never received the callback.

iii. I called up AMEX again yesterday inquiring about aforementioned commitment. I spoke to Namita (or Namrata) who mentioned she will arrange callback from executive who had given the above commitment around 12:30 pm IST. But again I did not receive any callback.

iv. I called up again today morning. Again I got a commitment from Sakshi that I will receive a callback in 5-10 mins from Namita, but again nothing happened.

I'm a member of Amex since 2013. I used to hardly used my Payback card back then. My experience changed when I became a Gold member back in June 2015. That's when I actually started using this card and understood the benefit of this card over all my other cards. In the month of October, I had booked an holiday package for a friend via MakeMyTrip worth 1.2 lakh. As per the offer T&C, I was suppose to get a cashback of 10% upto a maximum of 10k from MMT for using my Gold card. I was supposed to get the cashback credited by MMT into my Amex account within 21 days of the transaction. Those days turned into months since MMT kept finding tons of out of the world reasons on how I wasn't eligible for any cashback. Though this was an MMT offer, Amex impressed me since they completely took the ownership to follow-up on my behalf to get the cashback for me. After numerous follow-ups, MMT finally agreed to give me the cashback but only 5k in the month of March or April though I was eligible for 10k. Amex knew I was eligible for 10k and hence they still fought to get the remaining amount. Again this went for another few weeks and finally we both (Amex & me) gave up of getting the remaining cashback of 5k since MMT started ignoring us completely. That's when Amex surprised me. Since they knew I was eligible, they went out of the way and credited 5k from their side. Not via points but a proper cashback credit into my account. They didn't had to but they did. I've been using credit cards since almost 2 decades now and I know for a fact, no bank would ever do that. During this entire duration of 6+ months, I must have called MMT maybe 1 or 2 times. The entire thing was handled by Amex. That's what I call exceptional customer service provided by Amex and what customer satisfaction means to them. Other banks need to learn from them. Since then, Amex has always been my primary mode of payment for most of my transactions. One happy customer for life... Cheers...!!!

After I reached home started asking for help and started blocking my debit and credit cards. In the end I called American Express and told the representative whole story and he said we will take 48hrs or less to get you a card anywhere in US at no cost and I was zapped. It was a sunday night when I called and following tuesday evening I had my AMEX card on my door. Now this is service the feeling of getting card and knowing I don't have to ask for money was just incredible. That day I decided no matter what I am not leaving this credit card company ever.

The service was fast, efficient, effective and so conversational that those 5 mins or so were effortless & I actually wanted to speak more! The connect you guys build with your customers is awesome and deems genuine! One particular service that stood out was about getting a refund from Air India for a ticket I payed for with my old AMEX card, which was replaced by a new chip one. After days of running after Air India for a refund, I had almost given up, just when AMEX came to the rescue and sorted the entire thing for me!

Here's my story of American Express Card:
During one of my visits to Brazil, I was in Sau Paulo and went to a food court to get dinner along with some of my work colleagues. While I placed an order for a Veg Pizza (That was the only veg thing I could find there) I forgot my card at the counter. 
I had my dinner walked around with my friends and came back to the hotel .. While I was searching for my room Key I noticed that I dont have my card case with me... It freaked me out .. 
I called up American Express customer care and While I was on hold waiting to connect - In my mind I was having crazy thoughts of how would I settle my hotel bill etc and honestly I was little scared.. 
The call was connected and I asked the agent to block my card immediately- not sure how but she found my card details without me giving her any of it ... As I didnt had my card number with me...
The agent also informed that within next 48hrs, I will get a temp card sent to my hotel ... Honestly I thought that cant be possible... 
Next day when I came back from office and asked at the front desk they said nothing came so far ... 
I thought I should ask one of my colleague to pay for my hotel too ... 
Next Morning when i woke up, I saw a letter under the door of my Room and when I opened it .. it was my AMEX Card ... `I couldnt have been happier that morning as I was after seeing the card .. Stress free ... Thanks American Express for helping me out on this tuff situation and while I was stranded in an unknown country .. #MemberMoments","2016-09-10T17:16:01+0000",1,"1253557247997011_1254710247881711","168312979854782_1253557247997011"

Couple of months back I wanted to gift my Mom something good on her birthday but was tight on budgets due to several financial expenses that month. I searched for various options for gifting but could not get anything within my Budget and I was just looking at my Gold Charge Card statement and I realized that I had 18000+ Rewards Points in my account that I had collected almost in less than a year of my card usage. I browsed through the 18 Carat Reward Gold Collection of American Express and to my Pleasant surprise it had the best redemption options which Proved how brilliant is the rewards collection of American Express and I ordered for a Citizen Eco-drive watch for her absolutely free of cost and my Mom Simply loved Her Birthday Gift!

"122","10157621616415228","Sumit Mundra","I have been one of the biggest advocates of American express cards given my wonderful experience as a card member for the last 6+ years. I have had so many memorable experiences with Amex that it is tough to pick 1 or 2. I have always been amazed with how consistent my experience has been with them ever since I became a card member. One incident which I recall vividly was while traveling to Singapore, I had a big credit card bill to clear at the hotel which was more than my limit then. I called up Amex and mentioned my dilemma with my gold charge card and few seconds into the conversation, I was assured that my transaction would go through and that the issue would be sorted in 10 mins. What stuck me was when the Amex customer officer explicitly mentioned that I 'need not' call back specially cause I was on international dialing. I nervously asked the hotel to try my card 10 mins later and indeed the transaction went through. I was amazed with the precise and empathetic help I got from the gentlemen then. Being sensitive to my needs and also situation which literally blew me away. I had Airtel on the other hand who put me on hold for 4 minutes on the same trip when I was trying to activate a data pack on international roaming. The other incident that strikes me is when I raised a complaint with Amex re my base fare waived ticket on my Jet Amex Platinum card. The gentleman from Amex promptly conferenced the Jet counterpart as this was a third party complaint and stayed with me through out the call which he need not have done. Jet's rep was making me go around in circles till the Amex rep asked me to hang up and assured me that he will sort this for me. I eventually got a call from the Amex rep of the issue being resolved that day itself. My experiences have been live examples of how big the gap is between customer service at Amex and so called other reputed customer oriented organizations. #MemberMoments","2016-09-12T14:07:34+0000",0,"1253557247997011_1256545604364842","168312979854782_1253557247997011"

Being a student coordinator I am in touch with higher management people, Vimal Vyas and Amit Dhingra, as well as the relationship manager, Vikrant upadhyay. During my meet with them,each of them has asked me whether i face any issue with card or schemes, and also whether I would like to give them any suggestions. They would happily address my concern a d take the suggestion back on a positive note. At any level, first priority for them is to serve the customer. This level of dedication to serve the customer across the organization is what makes AmEx the world's most respected service brand.

Once I lost around 10k by purchasing a fake service from a seller in Romania and I did that transaction thru PayPal. When the dispute raised PayPal washed their hands as its a digital service and it does not fall under their buyer protection. So I thought I will try raising dispute with AMEX. I spoke to AMEX customer support and explained the situation. Believe me they credited 5 k on the call to my credit card account and the executive said this is a small gesture from AMEX to make me comfortable and they understand how stressful I might me after going thru all the struggle with seller and PayPal. With in 3 to 4 weeks my full money was refunded. I have no idea what AMEX did. I was overwhelmed. I have been using other credit cards for nearly 10 years. But AMEX stands top of all. With no hesitation I would recommend AMEX to others. Once you experience AMEX I am sure you will never look for other credit cards.

AMEX not just a credit card provider. They support you in every possible way if there is an issue when using their service. No matter what for them their customers are important and they help you. You will sense this when you speak to their support.

Finally one must use it to experience. They give away lots of rewards points. Transparent rewards points account to see all transactions and respective reward points. Perfect redemption offers. No false or fake promise. No complicating terms and conditions. It's all just straight forward.

On the verge of getting removed from my hotel, I made a last attempt to request an increase in my credit limit on my amex. I followed the usual procedure of calling up Amex customer care. I was patiently heard by Ajay from the customer care and was assured that there was nothing to worry and all problems would be solved in a followup call from the right department from Amex. And as promised, Usha called me up with few hours asked me to explain the issue. She asked me to make an immediate payment. When I told her that this was not possible as I was in US and I could not access my Indian account for various reasons..she took just a moment to tell me that there was nothing to worry and she would put in a request to increase my limit and also to extend my payment date. This saved me a lot of embarrassment and I felt proud of my decision to go with an gold card.

Though It makes one feel special everytime you reach out AMEX Customer Care, like a friend is out there to help you but this one was amazing.
I was travelling to Kerela with my Family in Apr 2015 and wanted to exchange my rewards points for Vivanta by Taj-Malabar, Cochin's vouchers. I was a few less than a thousand points behind to take two vouchers and called up customer care, to check what we can do about it. this gentleman (I don<U+2019>t recall the name) added points in my account on Behalf of AMEX and issued two vouchers. But this was not the end, We, in rush forgot the vouchers at my home which was locked, I called up customer care again when we reached Cochin and realized the vouchers were missing, I am not sure if that was out of the way but this lady from Customer Care spoke to the concerned team at the property and ensured I only have to pay amount after reducing 10k which was the combined value of the voucher, against which hotel only took the authorization and I couriered the vouchers to the property when I reached back home a few days later.

1. The customer service is just AWESOME. The executives have answers to all questions posed. 
2. The offers like Open Doors, Book my show, are just bang on and add value for loyal shoppers. 
3. The value that you see in the eyes of the merchant is like Wow., you hold Amex card is a booster.

Examples are galore for exemplary customee service. Once when I did not get Indigo vouchers in my mailbox, the executive arranged it asap and also called me back to confirm.

Hence, it is not only a credit card but all in all value proposition that enhances the overall likeability of the card through experiences, offerings, value, and am truly delighted to hold 2 Amex cards<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> #MemberMoments","2016-09-10T06:29:04+0000",0,"1253557247997011_1254319121254157","168312979854782_1253557247997011"

Dear AMEX MMT Credit Card provider: I using this platform to let maximum people know about your FALSE PROMISES, ZERO PROFESSIONALISM and DRACONIAN TURN AROUND TIME to resolve simple issues. 

1. About 2 weeks ago, i called AMEX cust care about my MakeMyTrip vouchers which had expired before the validity date was over. Till date I have not received the promised call back from the Manager - BHAWNA SHARMA nor have i received an resolution to the problem. I think your free vouchers was just a marketing gimmick to fool customers to buy the card. STOP MAKING FALSE COMMITMENTS IF YOU CANT DELIVER

2. Today, (6th September 2016) i again receive a text from AMEX to use code CTAMEXSUMMER in Cleartrip website to benefit discount of upto Rs. 2000/-/ Well, what do you know - EVEN THIS CODE IS INVALID!!!

I never expected that a brand like American Express will stoop to such low standards to sell their products/services!!!

How can you guys launch such campaign without any homework done and put your customer in such situation. I want a reply else you gonna listen through my legal counsel.

"310","10157676737865422","Varun Sharma","This is in connection to the closure request that I logged for my American Express gold card (ending in 51003), after I received extremely sub standard services by American Express. Let me be blunt here - I am furious that I am being played by the customer care staff of your bank for the past 4 months now. Even after I requested that No due letter be sent to me by the bank once I was forced to cancel my card on July 29, 2016, I HAVE to call the customer care executives every week to inquire about the status of the letter. There is no accountability and every time a new person apologizes on behalf of the bank. 

I have every right to ask you about the accountability aspect since I was using a ""paid card"". Instead of offering to provide me the contact details of a manager that I could call back directly, one of the customer care representative I talked to today told me not to use abusive language. When I challenged him to share even one abusive word that I used throughout the recorded conversation, he said, ""your tone is like that"". Do you expect your clients to say - ""Oh, I feel so sad your managers at American Express were so busy to take any action for the past 1 month on a simple account closure application, and I am sorry I am wasting your valuable time by calling you for 30 mins after every 15 days, but please would you do me this great favor by sending me a NOC letter."" 

I am being forced to waste half an hour or so on every call with people who are least bothered about what they make the clients go through. None of them has been able to give me any solution to the my concerns that I raised. Leave aside the solution, no one even had the courtesy to give me a call to tell me about the status.  

Please get someone responsible in touch with me, someone who can take care of this simple closure case so that I can get my No due letter from the bank. I won't say anything about taking action against your staff since I have no clue if you guys even take any action against these officials who make such hollow promises, give shoddy experience to the customers and accuse them of being abusive, even when there is not a single inappropriate word uttered on the recorded line. (I have a long list of people, ranging from customer care representatives to managers who gave me ""assurances"". I can share that with you if you want and you can cross-check against the names of people who handled my calls. I even remember the names now). 

And just to add, is ""Don't be abusive"" a better reply than ""Sir, Please allow me to give you the contact details of my superior/ some responsible person whom you can directly contact in case this thing is still not done?"" The only question I asked was ""What if still nothing happens after today's call too, since I have been hearing the same stuff for the past so many months and every time a new person answers the call over here?"", before I got accused of having abused your fine staff. Added response line was, ""Your complaint number is 16246135015, and you can call back again if nothing happens this time."" Am I that idle to keep making calls or do I not any other have a job to attend to?

Not that I would have wanted to say this but I am totally disillusioned by the nature of services provided by the bank!! Is this how a bank as reputed as American Express expected to conduct business?","2016-09-02T13:13:23+0000",1,"1243392679013468_1247397268613009","168312979854782_1243392679013468"

"320","1320864537925179","Manish Jain","Hi Amex

I am an Amex platinum reserve cardholder ending with 61008.

I wanted to express my dissatisfaction over the card and the benefits mentioned to us which doesn't exist when you actually use the card and when you call up the customer service you get a response which doesnt suit the brand value of Amex.

I have 2-3 issues which i wanted to highlight on a serious note as mentioned below:

1) I was / have been communicated that when you use your card on Make My Trip you will get an amount off Rs.300 cashback on one way trip, and i tried making a booking and found that the code MMTAMXPLT was highlighted as invalid code, I called up customer service and they told me the Makemy trip website is under maintenance and because of that you will not be able to use the code, so in this case if i go ahead and book i will loose Rs 300.00, the amex customer care person doesnt own any responsibility, they say we cannot help on the same, and no possible / alternate solution offered, as an amex card holder i fail to understand how the site is under maintenance when you are able to book tickets, pay by card and get the tickets in hand.
This is not the 1st time i have heard this story of site being on maintenance, as the same story was repeated when i ask the Amex customer care that when is book my show movie voucher offer is going to be available on Amex card, then the same response, sir site is under maintenance, and we will get it back soon, Till date no response on the same, and when today on the call i told the same thing to the amex customer representative or even to their superior, i am hearing the same thing again and again, sir the site is under maintenance

Being an educated person or even an uneducated person will clearly understand that if something is under maintenance, that if something is under maintenance then nothing should work however you can use the makemytrip site, select flight, book tickets, make payments, but sorry the Amex code which gives you Rs 300 cashback doesnt work since the site is under maintenance.

2) Another thing is about the golf access which they dont have the tieup in Kolkata, in all the other cities they have i.e. even in J&K but not in Kolkata, i was told that we will work on the same and its a process driven thing, but how much time does it take for such a global brand to get an access to a golf club for allowing its card holders to use it, you may probably hear the Golf Club is under maintenance.

I dont expect this kind of response and inappropriate excuses made by your educated customer care folks, which i presume they are. Also when spoken with the supervisor she was unable to give any solution and finally she stopped speaking from her end, the call was ongoing but i was not hearing anything from the other side.

Is this what you make card members to suffer, by asking them to have a paid card, please note if you have forgetten i have paid Rs 5000 plus service tax to get this card, and after a paid card or even if we use free card, we dont expect to loose any benefits but ideally we are being forced to accept to loose benefits

I am not expecting a solution but better be rest assured if this is your level of service and response from customer care, i would sooner than later choose to surrender the card rather than live under the story of everything under maintenancee

Thanks

Also it's a humble request to train your teams on customer service. Specially to these 3-4 agents I spoke to.

1.Only card I know that levies a surcharge for filling gas.
2.As the commission charged by AMEX from merchant establishment is one of the highest-majority of establishments refuse to accept this card.Outlets like Pantaloon and KFC regularly keep rejecting the card.
3.You have to pay for lounge access.There are numerous debit/credit cards that give you lounge access.
Change to any other card-it will be any day better than AMEX.","2016-08-23T05:13:57+0000",0,"1168536516499085_1238016409551095","168312979854782_1231012353584834"

---------------- Jagdish Kinjalk ------------------
Have you ever tried to talk with a Tree..? Perhaps not. Generally we talk with the persons, who can reply to our questions, who can utter some words..
Please try once to talk with a Tree. You will have celestial feeling. The tree will answer all your questions, like our best Friend. I am not joking.
Please try to do this. Pl. go in-front of a Tree silently. Concentrate your mind towards your question and stand there for few minutes. You will feel some positive energy. After few seconds, you will feel that you got a solution of your problem . Keep it in your mind. Act accordingly.
I try to pass my extra time in talking with trees. I get inspirations, new ideas, innovative views and solutions of my problems.

I decided to pick it up anyways after a persuasive call by one Rahul Paul who assured me that I had already uploaded all my details and all I needed to do was place a signature as the docs were not self attested. Subsequently, they wanted AS26 and had at least 3 other phone calls - and then a guy from Amex shows up at the house asking interrogatory questions regarding my house ownership. He was told to leave and return once I was back to have a chat - he obviously was an unpleasant person. He in turn has reported that my house and/ or office is non existent, and hence I cannot be issued a card that I did not want in the first place. 

Amex has been a colossal waste of time.

1) The first year charge will be levied on the completion of first year only.. A wide flat lie. The first charge that I see on my statement is a charge of 3500/-

2) The first year charges for Platinum travel card will be only Rs. 3500/- .. I was told about this and no other charges and when I open my credit card statement! Voila! There is an additional service charge of Rs. 525 levied on the card. Never was I told about charge, and the service tax that you charge is at amazing 15%!  Now, I am concerned about the second year charges that you will levy on my card!

3) You will be able to pay off the charges of first year membership fee with your Indigo vouchers.. And this is something that the sales executive was very adamant upon. And then, what I found out was, I believe you know the answer to that! No sir, you SPECIFICALLY cannot pay the fees through your indigo voucher points earned!

This has been just the first month of me using your high profile card which, ironically, doesnt work at 80% of the POS counters I have met in a city like Bangalore! I am completely flabbergasted on the cheating attempt of your sales executives to SELL of the card to me. Please PM me for my personal details so that you can check out the case history.

P.S. I was also promised a complimentary airport lounge access with the card, which, and I can place a bet on it, will turn out to be a lie again..

Even this year I had renewed the policy in Jan I have made numerous calls to the call centre. Once , the Amex call centre person patched me to someone in Metlife and the call lasted for more than 40 minutes. I was promised by Metlife that someone will call me within half hour to give my policy documents but its been over 2 months and I have recieved no communication. Extremely sad state of affairs and insurance as a product is to be used after a person'e demise.

They assured me that a new card would be delivered within 48 hours to the address I was staying at. However I was in the middle of switching houses from one friend to the other. I called AMEX while the package was in transit and requested an address change. Again, no questions asked. A duplicate card was delivered within 24 hours to the new address. 

Stranded without a wallet in a different country, I can't even explain the stress I was going through. AMEX service was top notch. The two other companies I hold cards from took an excruciatingly long time to even process all the information. AMEX had already delivered a card by the time they woke up. 

Kudos. And thank you, for your continuing high standards of customer care.

Recently I travelled to Indonesia and Thailand and again AMEX was there to take care of me. I used the card in my hotel, restaurants, ATM's, Malls, All stores, whatever you could think of. AMEX can be used everywhere. In Bangkok, I visited a roof top lounge on the 47th floor and to my surprise there was an offer on AMEX card. I felt privileged. Thanks Amex. You are the boss :-)

Recharge failed, gave another try, again similar process, recharge failed for $50. 

Finally traveled through cash recharged card, in an hour called AMEX, hey buddies these these things happened. 

Wonderful reply, no worries  SIR, AMEX will track all details. They satisfactory enquire all aspects, checked everything and says it's AMEX responsibility to settle these issue if the vendor claim for money, they kept monitoring for 3 to 5 days and gave entire solution and credit back to my account.

Couple of months Back something happened which instantiated my answer. My father's add on card was stolen. By the time we could report it, it was misused. However Amex being the customer friendly company did not once ask us to pay the liability. I was pretty touched by the gesture.
Now I come to the various offers/rewards(Bookmyshow coupons) which are unmatched in the industry. I have a busy lifestyle which involves frequent travelling. Sometimes I am unable to use the vouchers. Amex gracefully extends the expiry date.

I would not use any other credit card if possible. #membermoments.

A friend of mine had gifted me the American Express prepaid Gift card worth <U+20B9>5000. No gift will be as good as this. It was a gift of choice, that can be used anywhere and everywhere. 

On my wife's birthday we went for a dinner at a well know 5 star hotel. It was a surprise for her. We both had a wonderful evening together. I settled my bill using the American Express prepaid gift card. I also got 15% discount for using American Express card for bill settlement. This was like a cherry on an icing moment for me.

Priority pass, Sky miles, rewards points blah blah blah..... Almost every major card offers such services. 

On 13th March 2015, after working my ass off for 7 years, as I was about to write a cheque to Infinity cars to book my first Beamer, I was stunned when I was offered a massive discount for being an Amex platinum member.  

There is literally no other card that can get you a discount on buying a car.  Trust me, I checked!

I decided to pick it up anyways after a persuasive call by one Rahul Paul who assured me that I had already uploaded all my details and all I needed to do was place a signature as the docs were not self attested. Subsequently, they wanted AS26 and had at least 3 other phone calls - and then a guy from Amex shows up at the house asking interrogatory questions regarding my house ownership. He was told to leave and return once I was back to have a chat - he obviously was an unpleasant person. He in turn has reported that my house and/ or office is non existent, and hence I cannot be issued a card that I did not want in the first place. 

Amex has been a colossal waste of time.

"459","10154350679664230","Gaurav Yadav","Really pathetic customer service at the start of the account itself. I requested Amex to re-route the card repeatedly on my office address instead of the home address. On at least first call, some gentleman promised that I will get it on my office address in 48 hours. Later I found it was shipped back to the shipper. When I again called them they again promised and then no message was received by me. All this despite telling them again and again that I am getting relocated and am available only for 10 days in the city. The sales guys are more pathetic - they stopped picking up my call once they tried and found out that they can't get jobs done in their own company. Since their targets have been achieved they care no more. Whats worse is that they are avoiding my calls.  I have been all my life in sales and never thought this is what sales is. With zero or little commitment to help the account you just engaged with.  Just one word - PATHETIC!!!!  ( I expected better from AMEX)","2016-07-26T04:13:57+0000",2,"1209522419067161_1212775378741865","168312979854782_1209522419067161"

People saw this claim from them. I've had to delete our company page from Facebook as people were posting YOUR agents posts claiming I threatened to use my 25,000 apple red card limit to personally toilet paper your agents home. I don't have that card or that limit. I've worked on two presidential campaigns and am entirely embarrassed and have experienced severe financial distress because of this experience. You can find it on #americanexpress or #foxnews. Thanks for the libelous comments. I suppose I'll stay home today as I am out of work.

I am using American Express Gold card. 
Can you please let me know when you guys are going to issue me ""BookMyShow"" movie voucher for last month.
I completed my 8 transaction of 1000 rupees but still waiting for this voucher.

I tried to contact AMEX customer care but seems like AMEX has stopped this offer.
But even today itself I got a promotional offer which clearly mentioned this offer for new customer,. I can fwd you the mail.

It was mentioned clearly that I will get a movie voucher every month, this was conveyed by your representative.
Later I found out that 8 transaction of 1000 rupees in a month required for that, after this I found out that customer need to register it first.

Seems like Amex cheating customers by false offers.

I will make sure that current cycle will be the last one with Amex, I am going to stop using my Amex card after this cycle.

Sales Executive said very clearly to swip the card no need to register now; after you are done with 8 transactions you just call to customer care & you will be getting the Rs1000 voucher from bookmy show thru your register email. On 28 May I spoke with customer care he said ""Sir, do not worry in 1st week of June 2016 you will get your voucher"" .

Then after i have been contentiously calling customer care but nobody is ready to take a call & sad to say all look so helpless. 
Today, I spoke with customer care (Manager) he said Bookmyshow has declined the request & trying to tell me policy .

At the end I have feeling cheated by AMEX.

I am suppose to be a premium customer for AMEX from last few years and look at what I get from them. I placed some request to them. First of all their turn around time is very long for any resolution secondly if they call you to update this how the call flow is...... First it's a land line unknown number ...Hello sir good morning sir. I am this ... Calling from AMEX recorded line. Are you this ... If I say yes then they will ask your personal details straight related to your confidential data. I told them please give me the context of the call... That its regarding what request so that I can get some detail that it is a genuine call. I was asking them only subject of the call request not any details. But they did not reveal anything and in turn forced me to reveal my details. I told I can not trust this call and reveal my details to you like this upfront them they say this is how we work. I told them you are calling me in my registered mobile number and you can give me some hint that this call is about this or that..... But they always very adamant and when I told that this is not the right way to deal with the customer and that too a premium customer then they don't pay any attention. I told them this is your 3rd call in last few days and you are harassing me then no effect on them. My question is that is this your process ???? That straight forward from an unknown number you are asking me to reveal my personal details without any context. And your guys who are suppose to be so called in customer service speak to the customer in this tone and don't care about if customer is saying that if you are harassing like than then I will close this account. Then I don't want such bank to provide me services. You guys really need to understand the customer perspective and provide a nice experience not a horrible experience like this.

If I am in Delhi, I can be hopeful of using the full amount for possibly good seats in a multiplex like DT Saket or PVR Select.

However, if I am in Hyderabad or Pune where even the most expensive seats are at Rs. 250, half of my voucher goes down the drain.

So instead allow the remaining value to the customer to place order for the popcorn / nachos /pepsi etc which can be prebooked at the cineplex.","2016-04-28T06:59:13+0000",21,"1156072224412181_1156087237744013","168312979854782_1156072224412181"

The coupon is boasted to be worth 1000 bucks... But limited to 2 people... And that too only movie... No popcorn etc. 

Now, BookMyShow shall release some stats on how many %age of transactions has it ever done on its platform where people have bought only two tickets and cost was 1000 out of overall transactions done. My point is most of the tickets are in the range of 150 to 250. This is in Mumbai, smaller cities might be 100-200. So the person using this Coupon would always feel that he/she was not able to use the coupon fully... 

Why Amex as an organization be spreading such feelings... 

Better would have been to allow popcorn and drinks, which will allow people to utilize the coupon, as these are big costs these day with 500 for a tub and cold drink combo.","2016-06-04T04:08:41+0000",0,"1156072224412181_1178996155453121","168312979854782_1156072224412181"

I have redeemed my MR points of GOLD card for AMEX PREPAID GIFT CARDs. 
At the time of redemption i was told these cards will work at any mechant that accepts AMEX card.
Since last one month, I have been trying to use these cards on Paytm, Freecharge, Citrus, Mobikwik etc and everytime transaction fails with reason ""Transaction declined by Bank""

I have followed up with Customer Care (both credit card and gift card) but no resolution. All they have to say is transaction is authorised by AMEX. after that its merchant's problem. 
Merchant says bank declined the Txn. 

So ultimately who is wrong .. Me ?? for having taken AMEX card ?
Customer care commits to call back, but never calls back. they have no answers.

Can you look into the issue and resolve asap. 
If not then 
1. Refund my MR points and cancel the prepaid card.
2. Issue a clear advisory that AMEX prepaid card will not work for all websites.

I am sure the card will not work since prepaid cards dont have any OTP  and as per RBI guidelines, online txns must be processed thru 3rd level of authentication.","2016-04-22T12:50:27+0000",0,"1150438431642227_1152394221446648","168312979854782_1150438431642227"

The fiasco with Costco has cost me so much trouble and discontent.  I had a bunch of stuff autopaid on Amex.  On June 20th, Amex cancelled the card, all my accounts and left me high and dry.  Why they could not have simply issued me another card (without Costco membership) transferred all my autopay requests to that card shows that Amex simply does not care about customers.

"821","10207043734923995","Kim Joakim Gustafsson","Hello!  I have some serious concerns about the protection of purchases that are made with the American Express card as myself and several friends are getting different answers.  My understanding is that one of the benefits of using the card is that if I pay for something in the future (wedding venue, photographer deposit, Travel etc.) and one of the vendors then goes out of business that having put the charge (deposit) on the AMEX card would protect me in a case like that.  In other words, IF a company fails to deliver on the services that I have paid for with the American Express card YOU would protect me and dispute those charges.  Several friends and I are disputing something of this kind and are getting different answers.  Some no problem NO matter when the charge was made. Some are being told that anything over 12 months will NOT be credited.  BE clear that many times wedding venues, trips etc. have deposits due well in advance of a year.  What is the policy?  This far the friends that used Chase or any other Visa or Master Card have had no issue with their disputes it's only those of us that used AMEX that have had issues AND not everyone has had issues.  Some have immediately been issued temporary credits on any charge even beyond 12 months others have not.  Please clarify what your policy is.","2016-08-04T16:58:15+0000",0,"1142102949142442_1220095108009892","168312979854782_1142102949142442"

Hi Team,

I am not using any American express card, Still now I not received any American express card. I don<U+2019>t want to use any American express card.

I have attached mail ( send on  Thu 03-Mar-16 10:23 PM and Mon 14-Mar-16 1:38 PM)I don<U+2019>t want your card.

I not even know allocated card no and account no for me. I refused to receive that card. They promised whenever you want you can cancel the card. Before I send mail confirmation from my personal mail my friends said  American Express is not a proper organization .That<U+2019>s why I refused to send my details from my personal mail id. 
The same time  MR.P. BAKIA RAJ asked me my personal mail id Password. I don<U+2019>t know how they asked my personal mail ID  password by one of the organization manager.

Before I sent mail confirmation, next day I got call from MR.P. BAKIA RAJ saying your card is sanctioned. Then I send mail to him don<U+2019>t process my American express card. I have attached that mail.

Today I got SMS in my mobile I have to pay Rs: 1145/- I don<U+2019>t know why should I pay money without using your card or any benefit from American  Express. 

If I get any mail or SMS from American express I will complaint My HR (HPE) and I will do legal action against your company and MR.P. BAKIA RAJ. I already informed him before start processing. Please find my attachment mail.

I am expecting proper cancel notification form American Express and Mr.P. BAKIA RAJ.

On March 2nd, I applied online (sending all required documents to an employee) for a Jet Airways American Express<U+00AE> Platinum Credit Card to gain miles. I fulfil all the criteria mentioned online. After a week, one of your employees (Farhaan) called me and asked me that either I should have the salary of at least 10 lacs or a 6 months old credit card (which is not any criteria). When asking him the reason, he said it as the policy of American Express. This is not mentioned anywhere. 

Besides that, he and his team leader, Mr. Mukesh Kumar, tried to convince me to send a false e-mail on his mail that I have a salary of 10 lacs (which I don't have) and he assured me that he will get my application approved. I declined his offer and the same time called customer care to put a complaint again him. I was advised by your customer care executive to wait till the result come. I have called 3-4 times after it to your customer care too regarding the same.

Today i called again to know the status and I got to know that my application is declined because of site verification. I am completely confident that my home and work address is easily accessible. Now, I am very disappointed that as a potential customer, I have been so mentally harassed by your employee and services!!

I applied for a platinum Jet Amex card last year and it was approved. However, in spite of several reminders I have not received the card. This is EXTREMELY disappointing, and potentially a legal situation.

Could you please ask your customer support to get in touch with me ASAP to sort out the situation -

They just verbally book tickets with various vendors without any payment and the money to the vendor is actually given 72 hours before the departure.
In our case, due to such bookings visa got rejected.
So, without even paying a single penny to any vendor, they have kept 2,25,000/- of ours faking that money was forfeit by the vendor.
When asked to prove bookings done by them, they failed miserably.
Spread awareness about such frauds being done by makemytrip.

The transaction done using American Express Credit card on Amazon.in gets process without any OTP/PIN. Instead of OTP/PIN they are validating the transactions using your postal code, which is not at all confidential. Upon complaining this to Amex as a custom feedback, theirs customer care executives are giving you all the If...Then and probabilitie of unrealistic examples of Hotels and Kids.
I urge you all to please share this so American Express can take corrective action to safeguard the credit card holders and any probable fraud.

Since last (Saturday) night  i have spoken to Ramandeep (thrice), Unni Krishnan (twice), Tanya and Priyanka - from consumer card dept. (twice). I wasn't sure about the type of my Gold card - corp or consum. so what? i spoke to both depts. 

I mean really? what if i was on a holiday abroad and lost everything? Is this how you guys would have supported? - ""Mam' you need to provide your credit card no and your details are not there in our system. Sorry!"" 

Someone would have easily swiped the card. FYI - I had no issue in blocking any of my credit or debit cards with HDFC, KOTAK, CITI etc. all they needed was mobile no. email id name last digits of my card. That's it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The team wasn't able to trace my credit card with any of my details -pancard number, DOB, registered mobile no, email id or pincode no.? Hello! How is that remotely possible? I had to dig into my official emails with great difficulty which i didn't have access to,since its a weekend. When i finally shared my credit card application reference no. (from jul 25) its then when the team could trace it. Really alarming.

And the associate at end ends with a punch line - ""Mam the security is so strict that even we can't see it/get access to it"" - Hello? What is the point of this dept. if it is so difficult to block a card?

Really really really disappointed with AMERICAN EXPRESS !

Taj Group says they have no objection if American Express allows the same and Amex says that they have no objection if Taj allows but each still insist that it should be used by the primary card holder.

"1021","10153697464346653","Gupta Deepak","It seems American Express India is currently running a ""scam"" under their offer of providing movie vouchers if you spend Rs. 1000 in 4 categories each. I have tried this once. I paid Rs. 1000 in each of the 4 categories on the approved stores in September. But I did not get the coupon. Even after 21 calls to the customer care, the issue is still unresolved. On each call, their customer care executives promise to personally get this sorted out. The end result is as a customer I had to call them 21 times. I even got an escalation done on this (Ref. 15324185819) but still no response. I wrote an email to their highest body at head-customerservicesindia@aexp.com. Still no response. Basically, it is looking like a scam, where they do not give coupons or make illogical excuses, to tire down their customers. In the end, they make you pay more via their card, but without giving you the promised benefits.","2015-11-26T09:28:10+0000",1,"1060823450603726_1060924097260328","168312979854782_1060824353936969"

Placed order (Order No: 201489296), ""In Houz Murlin Queen Bed Mahogany bed"" on 24/04/2016.
Made full online payment and received order confirmation mail.

After 38 days of waiting, on 31/05/2016 Fabfurnish cancels order stating that product failed their quality check and they are initiating money refund which will take another 5-7 days.

Why didn<U+2019>t Fabfurnish do the quality check for that model before putting it up on www.fabfurnish.com , before taking the order and before accepting the payment ?
Once order is taken, isn't it FabFurnish's responsibility to deliver the product ?
Fabfurnish never offered any alternate solution, rather they simply canceled the order and initiated refund.

Fabfurnish keeps a big lump of my money for 40+ days and initiates refund.
They take money from customer, and return the same after 40+ days without any compensation.
Is this the new business model adopted by Fabfurnish to make money of earning interest on customer's money?

30 days after placing the order, I made an enquiry on 24/05/2016 for order status and Fabfurnish sent me an email that the product will be shipped on 30/05/2016.
But, on 31/05/2016, one week after shipment promise, the order is cancelled bluntly with an apology email.

FABFURNISH(www.fabfurnish.com) is a cheat company and is running a business of fooling customers.","2016-06-01T06:11:15+0000",0,"1047932848559453_1177118028974267","168312979854782_1047932848559453"

However there are issues I have faced with regards to acceptability of Amex Cards at H&M showroom in DLF Saket Select Citywalk,Delhi and Geetanjali salon in Ambience Mall Gurgaon. H&M flatly refused to transact using Amex card and Geetanjali mentioned that their Amex swiping machine is down. Please look into these, show that your customers do not face such issues. Everything else seems fine. Thank you.","2015-10-25T08:42:15+0000",0,"1046104555408949_1046936658659072","168312979854782_1046104555408949"

When I tried to use them on FLIPKART, it shows expired.

Flipkart said we always give vouchers with one year validity, that means AMEX gave me expired vouchers.
Since more than 25 days I am following up with AMEX at head-customerservicesindia@aexp.com and prerna.behl@aexp.com but there is no positive reponse.
Everytime I get scripted reply saying we will get back to in the next 2 working days time but for AMEX 2 days never ends :)

It is better to use other banks credit cards like HDFC/SBI (Indian brand) which can be used any where with ease of service.

Since the i have made atleast 10 calls to your customer care for this issue. I have spoken to Kelvin, Parimeeta and Ankit (floor supervisor). On Fri eve i get a voucher which according to shashi is a new voucher as the old one sent to me was a duplicate voucher and he accepts that its a book my show error which for me is you error!

To my disappointment the voucher given to me on 16 Oct, Friday was valid only till 15th Oct! Brilliant isn't it? Since then i have again been calling amex but have not received the voucher.

I am not able to understand why these people are not sharing the confirmation on card closure (may be because after 2/3 year they can come up saying that I have dues to pay and at that time I will not have any proof that my hard has been closed).

This is ridiculously frustrating how you are handling a simple process of shipping a credit card and the levels of incompetence is staggering . These are my issues

1) The ""nice"" people who sold me the card put the wrong address in the system DESPITE my MULTIPLE requests to send the card to my home address and not my office address. Even the office address is wrong! They have sent it to my business registered address which is a virtual office where no one sits. I never even gave that office address, it was for some reason pulled from my IT Returns as assumed to be the address the card should be shipped to, when I provided my actual physical home and office addresses

2) After two delivery attempts to the wrong address, I got a call from Miss Pooja, who ""understood"" the issue and said she will rectify it and re-send the card to the right address

3) The third delivery attempt was to the same wrong address after the first two delivery attempts failed even after supposedly ""REMOVING"" the wrong address from the system

4) Today the card AGAIN went to the same wrong address! What levels of incompetence is this?!

5) On top of this I already got my first bill of INR 5,700 and constant SMS reminding me to pay the credit card bill, when you cant even ship it correctly?

Please cancel this card. I have no interest in this","2015-10-17T12:11:45+0000",0,"1042224152463656_1043409522345119","168312979854782_1042224152463656"

American Express services in India
posted Oct 19, 2015 6:33 AM

The American express carries a big tag of status in India. The building, the staff and management, highly protected, remain protected. they do not come in contact with the consumer or customer. High EGO , High head and what not.

Just cheats, Liars and worthless. being highly paid are not concerned.

This Lady had been making a commitment from the last 4 months, just one reply

"1198","10210218708519739","Abhishek Srivastav","Hi,

Yesterday I appeared for an Interview with American Express. Chetan took my HR round and after written round I was forwarded to Operations round. This round was taken by Shvani. After almost 15 minutes of interview she rejected me. After asking for the feedback, she said that She asked me a question ""If I'll get a better opportunity within American Express but for a different process, will I opt for it??"". To which I responded Yes, Definitely. And that is the reason of my rejection. I just want to know if thinking of growth while staying in American Express is wrong??? I thought American Express is a very nice company but if a wrong person is given responsibility for hiring for American Express, its wrong for the company's image in the market and its growth.

It means that card data is already was someone and he was tracking all about this card, He/she knows that card has been activated and immediately did the first transaction with 1$ with balance check option and then done 398.05$ transaction online on this card. Person who has all the info he even knows that transaction is done but not posted by the merchant and he was very well aware about the time when this will get redeposited to the card and on the same day when that amount got deposited to the card he immediately did the another online transaction. Considering this entire scenario, I can defiantly conclude that its data hacked from AMEX database and its been used. However, knowing all the fact AMEX is just trying to escape from the situation and where their own data was exposed and its a security loophole in the system. I was considering AMEX as the most reliable and secure banking institution however, this issue has changed my belief and kind of issue address by AMEX is the worst experience I had ever.","2015-10-06T17:52:19+0000",0,"1038164139536324_1038592392826832","168312979854782_1105382706147800"

I have an Amex 500$ gift card and when I did the few transactions
around 100$, my card showed balance 0 and when I checked with Amex
customer care, I have been told that 398$ online transaction was done
on your card, which I never did.
So I reported that transaction as a fraud transaction. I have been
given assurance that this transaction will get declined and you will
get money back to card.

While asking about to prevent such fraud on my card, Amex Exe told me
if you register this card you can avoid fraud and I opted for
registration of the card however, the great customer care executive
asked me to wait untill you get your money deposited back to your
account and he did not registered card.

When I check the balance on 23rd Sept, 398$ amount got deposited and
again one more 397$ online transaction was done which was again a
fraud and within 2hrs of transaction time I report to Amex about the
fraud transaction.

I have been given assurance that we suspend this card and you will get
the new card and 397$ will be deposited in 7 working days to your new
card.
When I check with Amex Customer care executive (Samantha) on 30th Sept
she told that online transaction got posted and we can't help it.

Call redirected to Supervisor (Norra) and she didn't add any value to
the concern and no solution provided. Then call got transferred to
Deen - "" The Manager ""
and he admitted that it was an incorrect information given by customer
care exe. However, you will not get your money back. That's shocking
statement given by ""MANAGER"" . Even if Amex at the fault but customer
has to bare the cost of their mistake. IS THAT A PRINCIPAL OF THE AMEX
CREDO.

Here are few concerns and its not been addressed at all.

1. Card did not registered on request and asked to wait for balance to
transfer and let the fraud happen again. and same happened.

2. Given assurance by the AMEX on the second time fraud transaction
that you will get 397$ back to your reissued card and considering the
assurance I did not approach merchant to report about the fraud
transaction.

3. Why team has not involve the right team to investigate the fraud
issue and provide the right direction to the concern.

4. Unprofessional service

Expectation that due to wrong advice/direction/assurance I lost my
hard earned money and I need it back.
I have registered the complaint however there is not hope so this is
the kind of effort to get the right justice to my concern.

The American express carries a big tag of status in India. The building, the staff and management, highly protected, remain protected. they do not come in contact with the consumer or customer. High EGO , High head and what not.

Just cheats, Liars and worthless. being highly paid are not concerned.

A brand that is 160 years old in the globe is trying to kill itself in India. I just got an American Express Gold Card. 
They are going to charge me a fees for a credit card when every other bank gives it for free. I went to this Cafe in South bombay, a
very renowned one, over 50 years old. After having my meal over there, for the first time i was going to use my AMEX card. 
I took it out and presented to swipe it. The manager came to me and said the exact words
""Sir, You give us any VISA or Mastercard but this AMEX card we cannot accept, They charge a very high rate of interest which is unaffordable. 
Next i went to a pub in Pali village, Bandra West, Even there it was the same story. 
Can AMERICAN EXPRESS(INDIA) tell me why the hell are they selling cards if their card is not accepted anywhere in Entire Mumbai? 
Do they think we are fools? What the hell is the Merchandising team doing? Why do these sales guys sell their cards even?
I never faced any difficulty in using any of my other credit cards, but i think taking the AMERICAN EXPRESS card was the biggest mistake of my life. 
I am going to make sure that none of my friends, family members and collegueas ever apply for AMEX card.The worst CREDIT CARD company in India 
has to be AMERICAN EXPRESS. If the higher managemnet is not looking into this matter then they are just fooling themselves. They charge a hefty annual
fees, their card is not accepted and still they are selling. The organization that has allowed AMEX to function in India has to review. 

Stop Taking AMEX cards. Mumbai is the Financial Hub, But just see how degraded AMEX service is and which means how can i possibly take this card to any 
other place in india.

Please don't send your regrets message or customer service email id for my concern.","2015-09-28T14:50:05+0000",1,"1034853663200705_1034973753188696","168312979854782_1034853663200705"

"1234","1295800880438396","Ritesh Soni","Hello
I have an Amex 500$ gift card and when I did the few transactions
around 100$, my card showed balance 0 and when I checked with Amex
customer care, I have been told that 398$ online transaction was done
on your card, which I never did.
So I reported that transaction as a fraud transaction. I have been
given assurance that this transaction will get declined and you will
get money back to card.

While asking about to prevent such fraud on my card, Amex Exe told me
if you register this card you can avoid fraud and I opted for
registration of the card however, the great customer care executive
asked me to wait untill you get your money deposited back to your
account and he did not registered card.

When I check the balance on 23rd Sept, 398$ amount got deposited and
again one more 397$ online transaction was done which was again a
fraud and within 2hrs of transaction time I report to Amex about the
fraud transaction.

I have been given assurance that we suspend this card and you will get
the new card and 397$ will be deposited in 7 working days to your new
card.
When I check with Amex Customer care executive (Samantha) on 30th Sept
she told that online transaction got posted and we can't help it.

Call redirected to Supervisor (Norra) and she didn't add any value to
the concern and no solution provided. Then call got transferred to
Deen - "" The Manager ""
and he admitted that it was an incorrect information given by customer
care exe. However, you will not get your money back. That's shocking
statement given by ""MANAGER"" . Even if Amex at the fault but customer
has to bare the cost of their mistake. IS THAT A PRINCIPAL OF THE AMEX
CREDO.

Here are few concerns and its not been addressed at all.

1. Card did not registered on request and asked to wait for balance to
transfer and let the fraud happen again. and same happened.

2. Given assurance by the AMEX on the second time fraud transaction
that you will get 397$ back to your reissued card and considering the
assurance I did not approach merchant to report about the fraud
transaction.

3. Why team has not involve the right team to investigate the fraud
issue and provide the right direction to the concern.

4. Unprofessional service

Expectation that due to wrong advice/direction/assurance I lost my
hard earned money and I need it back.
I have registered the complaint however there is not hope so this is
the kind of effort to get the right justice to my concern.

Wherever they do use beware there is no guarantee that your transaction will be completed seamlessly. 3. Be extra careful when using the card in a crowded hotel to save yourself from embarrassment when others are staring at you that the card is not working/failed transactions or there are issues with the terminal. 4. The merchants that do accept the card often would discourage you from using AMEX (as AMEX charges them higher compared to other card services). 5. Always carry cash or other cards with you as this is not a card that you can blindly rely on. 6.  If you do complain about all of this to AMEX Customer support here is the answer ...Save your time and that of the reps....We understand your problem, we are working on it, we cannot do anything about what happened, we will not let it happen again, Forget it and keep using our card keep your redundancies in place for all payments.(But be rest assured that it will happen)","2015-08-15T12:28:22+0000",0,"1010801248939280_1010975482255190","168312979854782_1010801432272595"

But, recently I was trying to book tickets at jet airways web site and to my surprise I found that the tickets with promocode are costlier by 15-20% compared to tickets without promocode.

You can also try that by visiting jetairways.com and selecting your sector and try the pricing with promocode and without promcode. For example, with promocode a return ticket for chennai-bangalore for july last week comes to Rs. 8603/- whereas without the promocode it comes to only Rs. 7100/-

So this very month i had to book two international tickets and travel a bit in the domestic area which included some shopping. After booking one international ticket and making some domestic online use one fine day i enter the select city mall to shop i shop for 25grand and at the bill counter i happily forward the gold card the executive swipes it and says its declined i try and push the executive to swipe it on to another machine it again declines so i finally have to wait by the side and call the customer care to inquire whats wrong their they come up with this issue of saying you over used your limit so you cant swipe anymore. The point if their is a limit why isn't it being conveyed to the customer? so if he want to use it further he will clear the previous dues.  Further to the same i make a payment via the online mode i don't get the limit on the same day i have to wait for another 24-48 hours to reopen the limits.

It's unbelievable and sad to come across poor customer service and really weak security system.

This is to bring to your notice, that I have been a member of Amex since 2-3 months now.

Till date I have not received any of my membership cards from Taj/Trident/Priority Access/Insurance.

Now it has come to my notice that I haven't been given 11000 membership points which are complimentary with your Plat Reserve Card, even when I have paid my membership annual fees.

This is no way of providing services. I will have to file a complaint in the consumer court for this betrayal of your company. Your managers don't even have the courtesy to reply to my mails, or get these issues resolved on priority. For sales you people can call everyday and followup every day, what about the After Sales Services? These promises and offers given by you people??

I better get a reply from you people this time by end of this week. Do not underestimate the power of a Consumer. One unsatisfied customer is enough to blow your goodwill and reputation in the market.","2015-06-10T08:36:00+0000",2,"974509072568498_975397305813008","168312979854782_974509072568498"

The first time around the agent collected all my documents and kept telling me that the card is under process while at the back end it got cancelled and I got information or response from him. The second after waiting for almost a month when the card came to me, the name on the card was wrong and other details were missing. 3.) When contacted customer care twice the call disconencted due to network issues on their end to which I kept saying 'hello' and they promptly disconnected the call and never bothered to call back. 4.) The credit limit I received was pathetic and much worse than my other cards.

I would like to point out my experience from the recent visit to one of the Restaurant (Gopala Next <U+2013> in Bhandup locality) which is a listed one under the Standalone category for the Movie Block Buster context. In last 20 days we have visited this restaurant twice and find that AMEX card was not been accepted. During our 2nd visit (on 26th April), I happen to meet the owner of restaurant and I flagged the issue, that though listed on AMEX portal why the amex card is not been accepted.
The reply was very embarrassing and also interesting at the same time. I was been told that the Restaurant is very much interested in accepting the AMEX card but they do not have a proper connection (or connection got distorted), which they have complaint to AMEX Team. They told that AMEX guys have no time & person to get this sorted out even after repeat follow ups. The owner the mentioned that he have also offered a special discount to AMEX card holder of 10% on food bills, but still he did not get any response from AMEX Team. He then asked me that what else they could do.
I find this instance to be quite embarrassing and was not comfortable to use the AMEX card. 
I also find it strange that AMEX being world repute, do not have a tracking of its active outlets and resolve the issues. This really gives a concern as a user of AMEX card.","2015-04-27T05:09:56+0000",0,"946884555330950_956447957707943","168312979854782_946884705330935"

"1602","1269184636434222","Dinu Gaikwad","Hi All,

I am writing this post, so I can bring to your notice what an exceptional team members you have in your team. The ticket no is 15078183833.

It<U+2019>s always been a pleasure and confident feeling (knowing that the issue will be address) to speak to an representative whenever I call in the Customer support Number of Amex. But this time I would like to tell you about the stupendous effort and support that was provided by Kirti (hope I spelled her name right). I have been always facing issues with Blue Dart delivering the cards to me according to my timing which falls in their last delivery slot and I have to end up either re-routing the package to different address of else I have to come to office as per the time they request. The same thing happened when my new Amex Card Arrived. We were facing issues with the Delivery time and as usual all my efforts of talking to Blue Dart failed.

So I end up calling the Amex team for the same on 17th March 2015 and they assured me that they will arrange the Drop on 18th as per my time, but somehow it didn<U+2019>t happen or their request was not heard and the Second attempt also failed on 18th. So I have to end up calling Bluedart and agree to come to 2 hrs early and collect the card on 19th march. But as always Blue Dart sent them 5 hrs early and 3rd attempt also failed.

So I again called Amex for help and this young lady Kirti answered the Phone and greeted me in confidence and heard me patiently. She not only understood the issue but also confidently took the Ownership of the issue. Started firing up calls to the Bluedart team to get the issue resolved, She even became a victim of call drop from Blue dart but she was determined to help me and get me the card and made sure leave no stone unturned. She promised me that I will get my card on 20th even though the representative of Bluedart decline her request of delivering the package late evening. But she had decided that she will not let me down and promised me that the issue will be taken care off. I have been on this position of Operations Head for a long time now and I had started my journey as a Frontline Agent, I always felt of going an extra mile for my customers so they feel special. That was the same feeling I got from your team. (Not even thinking of the issue will be resolved or not)

But the Icing on the cake happened later in the Evening, I got a call from the Blue Dart office asking me if I was available in office as they want to deliver the package to me, Suddenly a smile came on my face with the words <U+2013> Thank you Kirti. I got the Card at 21:25hrs in the night.

I just want to say Thanks to Kirti for all her help  and would love to wish her Best of Luck for her future and at the same time would love to congratulate all you Managers and Process Owners for employing such Gem of person in your team who know how to make you guys proud with their work.

At last before Signing off <U+2013> I would like to thank Kuldeep, Avinash and Ankit who were also part of this Quest.

Sorry guys to hold you on your screens for a long time.

Thank you once Again. You guys can reach me anytime for any question on the below numbers.

Also, one of those 5 categories isn't practical. i.e. a spend of Rs 1000/- in single swipe on movies isn't practical, as most kids don't want to watch the movies that the parents do, and most parents can't see the kids movies.

Since last 4 days I observe at chakala metro station mumbai where Amex india desk is put up, it seems your sales guys only ask the male passengers for the cards but conveniently ignore the females...hard to believe that they still think only males can use and afford the Amex cards...I was actually inquisitive about the Amex card and the schemes but your sales guys were busy offering it to the men who simply ignore them....I must say the brand is getting tarnished with this kind of attitude...they must know women also have a v good purchasing power....please do not just train them but help them develop a right attitude

Not very motivating at all to go out and use the card , specially for a family person the limit of getting only 2 free tickets is big drag, it really does not matter to have the price increased to 1000 as much of it lies un-used . If y ou really want to make the program worthy i would strongly recomend to remove the cap on the number of tickets insted let the money be used to the fullest , else there is not much benifit for the customer and it ends up only as a marketing gimmick.","2015-03-08T02:56:04+0000",0,"897395983613141_930066897012716","168312979854782_897396043613135"

I noticed due date is approaching on my prepaid card and hence decided to call customer care to issue me a new card. Service rep responded that I should get in touch once the card gets expired as it has still few more days of validity. This to me seem odd, however I agreed thinking it to be part of the process.

I called the customer care again to renew my card for Diwali shopping and was in rude shock that the card cannot be renewed as I should have called within 90 days of validity period and I am calling around 100th day.

This is something which I certainly donot expect from Amex for below reasons:

1. I was never told that I need to contact within 90 days after card due date in my initial call

2. My proactiveness wasn't responded well in my first call. I specifically wanted card to be renewed and after informing the bank, you could have done the same without asking me to call again or dropped a note/sms mentioning need to renew my card as I have already created account profile

3. How can my amount be forfeited? If I am a credit card customer and I don't pay the due amount then can I consider amount forfeited for whatever reasons.. for instance you failed to send me payment notice within 3 days of my payment cycle citing it to be my policy.

I am completely dejected at the service provided by Amex whose exemplary service standards are part of service industry folklore.

I am looking up to you to uphold the reputation of Amex and providing me with new card without any more follow ups.","2014-11-01T06:21:21+0000",0,"861453147207425_861865780499495","168312979854782_861453307207409"

"1767","10154016408637337","Akshay Nair","American Express, 
Hope you had a good Diwali. I certainly did not. 
Last month, I had made a transaction for 19890 INR (on an IVR Telephonic line), but my Amex Platinum Card was charged for 1,989,000 INR. Two extra zeroes - who would have thought it made such a difference?
So normally you would expect such a transaction to be voided or declined, right? Especially since my credit limit is only 350,000 INR; but guess what Amex actually approved the transaction! Not only that, you also blocked my card for 3 weeks after that since I had obviously exceeded my credit limit (Obviously!). I was promised that the card would be activated within a couple of days but it took 3 weeks and my auto-debit transactions to have the electricity, cellphone company bills and insurance premium - all of them were declined! Not only that, I had to suffer the embarrassment of being handed my card back at restaurants since my card was 'declined'. 
Despite numerous calls to the Amex call centre, nobody could tell me:
1. Why did Amex approve the transaction?
2. What is the point of having a credit limit if a transaction nearly 6 times its value is being approved without even checking with the cardholder?
3. Why did it take three weeks to re-activate my card, when you promised it would be done in 2 days?

Finally, last week, a customer care executive called up to tell me that the issue was resolved - no attempt at an apology, no effort to pacify me, no endeavour to address my questions and issues and absolutely no bid to redress my complaints and my anguish. 
All swept under the carpet and everything is as it was before. 
What about the trouble I was put through and the aguish I suffered?
I wonder sometimes why I paid 50,000 INR for membership fees for this 'Platinum service'; Why, my HDFC debit card (which is free by the way) works just as fine.

Any thoughts?

After 3 weeks, I get a letter with the merchant's original bill attached - saying the dispute is closed and the amount was re-debited in my account!!!!! Man, I have a copy of the bill - the dsipute needs to be settled by getting into details!!!!! I was of course not satisfied with the resoultion and made a call to reopen the dispute, which was accepted by your executive. Hence, I made the payment for Aug month substracting the disputed amount and the late fee - agreed to with your executive. After this, for the last 2 months, I have been receiving harassing calls to pay up the amount. Everytime someone new calls and says there is an over due amount - Always I have to explain over 15 mins how the amount is disputed etc. They say they have taken note- but again I get a call saying amount is due - I got atleast 10 such calls. Now my card has been blocked for ""non-payment"" if the disputed txn. I have made calls over the last 3 days asking for unblocking my card- everytime they say they will get back and solve the issue by the next day - and the next day someone new calls and asks me to ""phrase"" the problem again!!!! I have done it several times already.","2014-10-19T08:01:08+0000",0,"853060694713337_855208457831894","168312979854782_853095981376475"

Please note, this is just unbilled amount and the bill has not been generated yet. Below are the few things that need to be answered.
Firstly, I was never told that there will be a certain limit that I can spend on my card. Had I been misguided intially?
Secondly, the due date to make all my payments is still far ahead and why are you asking to make a pre payment now itself?

If you check my CC history, till date I have used more than 3 cards and my transaction history have been excellent on all the cards till date and have never come across this kind of bad experience on any of the CCs.
The only reason I opted for AMEX card is because of the more credit limit but now I think I made a wrong decision opting for this card.

The last thing I would like to say is that, recently I received an email saying there will be no reward points for the transactions on Insurance, fuel and utility bill payments.
So now I have a question for what sake I need to continue this service? Please let me know the procedure to discontinue and cancel the service.","2014-10-17T05:15:24+0000",0,"853060694713337_854232417929498","168312979854782_853095981376475"

"1844","10209180657611982","Rajesh Mutneja","Dear AMEX team,
I just wanted to share you the pathetic experience I am having with American Express Card. I hold a gold charge card from American Express Card. At the time of enrollment it was told that if I use this card for more than 1000 Rs in a month, I<U+2019>ll be getting 1000 rewards point. Also on top of that I was told about the block buster movie offer.
These are really good offers, but other side of the coin is really dark. None of the merchant in my area accept the card. Even the vendors which are listed under https://www.americanexpress.com/india/movie-offers/ do not accept the card and eventually I<U+2019>ll not be able to get any reward point and / or movie ticket. When I called the customer support they advise me to call them when I am at merchant<U+2019>s site. Wow, I didn<U+2019>t know that I have that much free time to spend for each transaction I make. Why should I not simply stop using the card and why should you not return me the membership fee which you have charged me for a card which is not accepted anywhere.  
It is really unethical behavior and I feel cheated by having relationship with American Express Card. I am sure I am not going to get any solution for this but still thought to share the feedback with you.","2014-09-24T05:23:12+0000",0,"841627569189983_841922875827119","168312979854782_841627615856645"

 I hold Amex platinum card and as well as gold charge card.Earlier I had given standing instructions for Insurance policies on gold charge card. I requested in jan/Feb 2014 to transfer these SI to Amex Platinum card.You can verify same from your voice call records. Also your customer-care executive assured they are transferred to platinum card. But in the mean while Rs 30,000/- SI transactions occurred gold charge card. Ideally this should have been occurred on Platinum card and this would have added to achieving the target of 3,90,000 to avail this card's benefits.

I called your customer care but they are not able to help me to transfer this spend to Platinum card.3 times I had requested callback for which i have not got any call from supervisor.I am not getting any satisfactory answer for this.Please help me to resolve this amicably.   See my association with Amex and respond.Here are card details

Card Number : 3769 XXXXXXXXX
Name : Shivanand Naganur

For any queries please call me at XXXXXXXXX. Do let me know any other details you need

I called Taj reservation.

If the team takes so long to find out the eligibility of the person for carrying credit card then I doubt on the team<U+2019>s capability.

Hence, I recommend to take the necessary steps again all the people who are looking at this account.

I manage a customer service department and if we provided service this bad I'd get fired. On March 28th I attempted to book three tickets on the American express travel site. As I was booking the second ticket the site crashed and instructed me to call the 1800 number to complete my booking. I did that and spoke with Tamika who was not helpful. She told me I couldn't book three separate tickets for myself and my children and then offered no other solution. I had to ask her how she could help me book through your site and she said, ""well I can book it for you."" After twenty minutes of her telling me the site was slow and non-responsive, I asked her to just cancel my ticket and ensure the second ticket was canceled since it was being processed online when the site crashed. I would just book online at united. She said since I bought the first ticket with points the cash would be refunded but not points and I said fine. As she was trying to refund the ticket HER PORTAL crashed and she said there was nothing she could do to help me until her system was back up. Listen to the quality control recording. You'll hear it all there. She said when her system was back up she would refund the ticket. Well guess what? She never did. When I called to get American express to fix the problem caused by the American Express System crashing the nice lady told me on the phone she would immediately credit my point back. Then she kindly got american express travel on the line to ensure the ticket was indeed cancelled. Back on the line with american express travel I received horrific customer service again on a static laden line. The agent called united while i was on the line and came back twenty minutes later to tell me it was too late to cancel the ticket and I'd be charged a fee of hundreds of dollars. I called the second the american express site crashed. It's not my problem their systems are inadequate. She escalated me to her supervisor who was also on a static laden line and the supervisor said they would review it and get back to me in two days. Today I get a call from a membership rewards person who said if she credited back my points she would CHARGE MY CARD another $310 for it. What the heck AMEX? Your site crashed and your customer service failed and I'm still out 31,000 points for a ticked you said you would cancel but never did. I'm never booking through american express again and i'm telling everyone i know about the horrible experience. American express once had the best customer service in the industry. Being a cardmember since 2004, more than once their customer service was so good that I chose to stick with them rather than go to a card with a lower annual fee for that sole reason.

Yesterday, I had to wait for more than 15 minutes to get someone talking to me on the other side. It is the same story again today. Extremely frustrating. This I didn't expect when I signed up for Amex about 2 years ago. I hold 2 cards with you guys, with a possible upgrade planned to one of the premium cards.

I have been cheated enough times in my 1 year relationship with American Express cards that I am certainly not recommending it to any of my known friends. I was initially promised by the Amex Sales guy that if my spending is good, I will get my membership fees waived off. Now after one year, I am being asked to pay the membership fees even after having a healthy charge amount every month. This is ridiculous customer service to say the least.

Was your Amex official not competent enough to know what all documents are required? Even after all this hassle we called the customer care again and the lady there had no clue on what's happening...and asked for 3 - 4 days time to revert... 3 - 4 days..really?

- theft is excluded [hello! that's more likely than any natural calamity in urban areas / metros];
- only inside your home is covered so any portable device taken outside is excluded which would include all mobiles / tablets / laptops etc.
- all jewelry & watches are excluded;
- only for 1st 90 days after purchase;
and the list goes on so basically you will never qualify for coverage when you have 99% of claims

these exclusions are usually not mentioned over the phone when you are cold called to buy this insurance [even on dnd mobiles but that's a different issue] - its not in the card-member's interest to be forced to buy additional covers that they will not be able to use [abroad such anti-choice mandatory covers would be a regulatory violation if not outright illegal]

Interesting story. i called call centre. being a reserve card holder supposed to get some exclusive services, but our indian counterparts are Indians and behave like indians. Why shouldn't they . They are proud Indians like I am.

However i was seeking information about transfer on my reward points to Skymiles at Delta. In the first instance by Delta I was confirmed that ti can be done. I need to get in touch with my Bank. Delta and amex has a tie-up of cobranded cards.

Then at Amex great man Mr. Shah informed me after lot of waits and chit-chats in office that yes it can be done. I have to first apply to Singapore airlines and then request them to shift to Delta. I was a bit surprised to this information, reason I was not comfortable that this system will work, but then thought to try it as ti was coming from the horses mouth that is Amex call centre. However to my surprise my doubts came true and it was not true. I was just made a big fool by the great personality of Amex whom they have given the job.

Then again I reverted back and Ms. sunaina, some sweet voice came on line. She read the conversation and then said that yes it can be. I requested her to please connect me to the supervisor or floor in-charge as I do not agree to the same. for full 15 minutes i was holding the line, but no one came forward after that. See the colossal amount of time these people are wasting both of their own and of the card members. 

Why do we pay them so much to acquire such so called prestigious cards, when we meet this situation. i would love to surrender the card then to be harassed like this. I am holding 2 hundred thousand reward points. Imaging what sort of business I have given to them.

Shame on their system and the asia pacific incharge for the continuing delays year after year.","2014-01-26T09:10:32+0000",0,"721089781243763_3871558","168312979854782_721089814577093"
"2299","10153715654742757","Dishant Sachdeva","Amex agent (Naresh Kumar Soni) approached me to apply for a credit card and assured sharing his mobile no for any kind of queries/assistance .After handing over all the documents and getting a call from amex that card has been approved and will be delivered in next 7 days.After three weeks of not receiving card i had contacted customer care and was told the card was declined due to address verification failure (without any intimation you people want us to stay at home all the time). No intimations has been provided to me for this kind of verification.When i called the agent for further clarifications he started arguing that the mail/letter had been delivered without having any basis even after telling him that i have checked email he kept on asking me to check the mailbox again and again and again ....hoping that i would receive the email NOW  .Next he started saying that I was checking my mails over the phone so I could not see the mail.After telling him that I was not checking the mail over my phone but on the laptop he refused to accept this simple thing. Few things I would reques an international bank like yours to educate your agents about are: 1)Pls train your agents to deliver the correct information to the customers and understand the exact issue before arguing about it with the cx. 2)Information regarding any failures to the cx. 3) Agree with the cx in case he says that he has not received the intimation instead of arguing or getting rude. 4)Handover the documents back to the cx if the card is not delivered to the cx. 5)Never approach the cx for any credit card applications.","2014-01-21T11:19:58+0000",0,"721089781243763_3861972","168312979854782_721089814577093"

A plethora of mails have been written and responses given are never satisfactory. An ever eluding ""relationship manager"" who does not seem to care for the position she holds whatsoever. Information being provided seems to always contradict with the ground realities.

We dread our decision of choosing American Express as our partners in corporate payments. Simple requests have not been able to cater to, we wonder how larger conglomerates are serviced.

The whole purpose of opting for a service such as yours is to ease the operational difficulties and eradicating the efforts in maintaining the ancillaries of business rather than the business itself. But unfortunately it seems it is expected that from your team that we engage in coordination activities among your bill desk and other departments.

AMEX replaced Kingfisher First Platinum Card (paid Rs25000 for lifetime) with Travel Card. After using this for one year, we feel cheated by AMEX.
After spending for Rs4L, 
1. You get Vouchers from Indigo Rs16000 (which you can redeem only one time, if you cancel your journey you cannot reuse)
2. Taj Voucher is not transferable so no monetary value. Best Available rates are around 50% higher than package rates.  You do not get any meal with room booked. Many times Room with Breakfast is cheaper than Best Available Rates
3. You get 10000 Amex points which are not worth Rs2500

What we lost:
No Lounge Access
No Upgrade Vouchers
No Free Tickets
1Lac King Miles which you could use for Free Tickets which are cancellable

AMEX PLATINUM TRAVEL card is not at par with Kingfisher First Platinum Card. They got more other options like The New Jet Airways Amex Platinum Credit Card
They took Rs25000 for life time card & replaced same with low value card.
Customer not only lost Kingfisher Miles but also lost Rs25000 paid to AMEX
AMEX made no effort to satisfy customer for lost value King Miles & free tickets
All of them who got Travel Card, must cancel same & stop relation with AMEX till they offer equal card or pay back Rs25000 paid to them","2013-07-10T11:32:12+0000",1,"621573074528768_6651151","168312979854782_621573074528768"

Hi

It is very disturbing to write again and again and there seems to be no response from your side. 
I am yet to receive the statement from your side and this is very annoying as the next statement is about to due and the address remains unchanged from your side.
Now I don't know I will need written response from your side for the delay and would like to seek the compensation for the harassment caused from your side the amount of time effort and money has been wasted in calling you, emailing you( YOU DONT EVEN RESPOND for that matter ).

I will be consulting my legal team to how to go to consumer court to seek damages and have already circulated mail about stop using the Amex Card in my organisation. 

You mark my words you will see very soon in renewal of the cards of employees from my organisation ICRA Limited because of your careless and pathetic approach towards consumers.

regards

Vipin Jindal

I did cross the limit as well as got the letter from Amex re the same. However, its been more than 3 weeks and the voucher has not been delivered despite multiple follow ups. Please note the reference no. for the complain I raised with your customer executive as well: 13138143225. 

I have been told thrice that somebody from back end team will call back but nobody does and I have come to an opinion that Amex doesn't want to deliver this set of vouchers to the rightful customers. I am really put off by this incident and never expected this service from your premium company.

1. I call Amex and complain about the service.
2. They tell me thats all they can do...so I tell them to Cancel my card and they say OK
3. I write on face book and they call me to tell me everything is taken care off and we will wave off the extras 
4. I get a 50% off on my annual fee (imagine I hadnt asked? god...), imagine they tell me its a policy....a policy that let them give it free in the first year and then discount 50% cause I complained
5. They send me a mail saying a new card and new credit limit and no late payment fee and no finance chanrges
6. I get a card with the same old credit limit
7. I get a new statement which is exactly the reason I called Amex in the first place....

Need some advice here....do i start the process all over again....

This is why I said, cancel the card....i pay what I need to....dont bother...its a waste of time. 

A totally dis-satisfied customer who will ensure he spreads the word around....

"2876","10154578968726303","Deepali Seth Pawar","I Completely agree with Vinod on this. I am amazed at the customer service of their employees. They have no sense of accountability or responsibility. Customer service is not only limited to your toll free no's, every individual who is part of the organisation is the face of the organisation, whether it is a sales personnel or a call centre employee. In Feb I was sold a Platinum reserve card which came sometime in beginning Mar & I has also applied for a supplementary card through the Sales guy. He took all the required documents & told me the supp card will come along the main card. In the beginning they promise you to handle all their queries, do anything to get a successful sale. At the end it never came. After continuous follow-ups, I had to resend the documents to him but still no card. Then I had resend the documents to customer service, again I follow-up with these guys cant trace the application & yet again they ask me to resend the documents.I called this morn to check on the status, they again asked me ""Ma'am have you sent your documents?"". This has become a joke & its quite annoying. We are in May now & still I have not received the supplementary card. I have asked them to arrange a call back with someone senior but that still has'nt happened. I try to reach the sales person who was in touch with me, he refuses to answer any calls or reply to my E-mails. I dont know what kind of procedures & training is Amex following. Secondly I had an issue with the registration of the Accor membership, Customer service ladies promised me to call back after checking for a solution with teh seniors but till date it has'nt happened. I ahve called them atleast 10 times but none of my problems have been resolved. The senior management is either oblivious of all this or just doesnt care. If this is the kind of service a Platinum card holder gets , I really wonder about others. To give a benefit of doubt I could be an exception but noone has bothered to come forward & resolve my issues & take accountability for it. In my eyes Amex has failed in customer satisfaction, forget about exceeding the expectations or customer delight. If you are selling a lifestyle product, behave like one atleast. I really dont know who to reach out to anymore. If any of the management team gets to read this, One request, Please buck up, otherwise you might dilute your brand image.","2013-05-07T06:55:30+0000",0,"586794214673321_6470003","168312979854782_586794214673321"

Probably worst than ICIC's or HDFC's. 3 weeks ago i approached the fraud department since there were few fraudulent attempt on my card. I was told that my card is blocked now and they will re-issue a new card in 10 days time. I called up almost after 2 weeks to check the status and was told that my card is cancelled and new card cant b issued until the internal investigation is over!! And i was told that i will receive a call back in 24 hours. No one called!! Then again i called after 48 hours, same answer and this time even more bizarre, ""Sir the fraud team for Indian cards is based in usa""!!! What??? ""Oh i'm sorry sir i was wrong, its in india but they have left for the day. We will arrange a call back in 2 hours""!! After 2 hours i call again, ""Sir we dont know what is happening but dont worry, we will have someone call you back""!! So i asked if i can speak with fraud team, ""Oh no sir, they don't talk on phone they only help through emails""!!! What??? That is the same bloody team who took the request to block my card on phone!!! And now i realize that the card has been cancelled without even me authorizing that and no one has a clue how it happened!! All you guys have been doing is giving me a run around for a service against which i pay a monthly bill!! I can understand delay, but how do guys wish to explain these atrocious responses from people who are supposed to be trained on your policies?? No one has a clue about what is happening with a credit card??

"2951","10211085641719632","Shiv Sood","The worst and most bizarre customer service. While i thought that Amex would have little more sensible team to help customers but ALAS, i was so wrong. Probably worst than ICIC's or HDFC's. 3 weeks ago i approached the fraud department since there were few fraudulent attempt on my card. I was told that my card is blocked now and they will re-issue a new card in 10 days time. I called up almost after 2 weeks to check the status and was told that my card is cancelled and new card cant b issued until the internal investigation is over!! And i was told that i will receive a call back in 24 hours. No one called!! Then again i called after 48 hours, same answer and this time even more bizarre, ""Sir the fraud team for Indian cards is based in usa""!!! What??? ""Oh i'm sorry sir i was wrong, its in india but they have left for the day. We will arrange a call back in 2 hours""!! After 2 hours i call again, ""Sir we dont know what is happening but dont worry, we will have someone call you back""!! So i asked if i can speak with fraud team, ""Oh no sir, they don't talk on phone they only help through emails""!!! What??? That is the same bloody team who took the request to block my card on phone!!! And now i realize that the card has been cancelled without even me authorizing that and no one has a clue how it happened!! All you guys have been doing is giving me a run around for a service against which i pay a monthly bill!! I can understand delay, but how do guys wish to explain these atrocious responses from people who are supposed to be trained on your policies?? No one has a clue about what is happening with a credit card?? I would have been lot better if i had to only pay those fraudulent charges (That never even went through in the first place) than dealing with a ""no-brain"" team.","2013-04-02T12:33:20+0000",0,"574351215917621_3204656","168312979854782_574351225917620"

Though now you have allowed the MR points to be transferred to any other airline besides Kingfisher, but earlier when I had the Kingfisher First Credit Card, the MR points were transferred automatically to Kingfisher Airlines. I have a huge amount of points in Kingfisher airlines which I am unable to use since the airline operations are suspended. I request you to please find a way out to compensate AMEX card users for this loss for no fault of theirs. 
It is important to note that initially when you enrolled me for this card, we had the choice to transfer these MR points to Kingfisher as and when we wanted but later on you started transferring these points automatically every month. It is because of this that we are deprived of utilising our MR points today. AMEX should find a solution to this in order to facilitate its card users","2013-01-26T06:15:13+0000",1,"545924908760252_2908949","168312979854782_545924918760251"
