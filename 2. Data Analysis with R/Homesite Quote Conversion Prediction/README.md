# Homesite Quote Conversion Prediction

The Homesite quote conversion predictive modeling script contains the R code with sample outputs/visualizations of the complete modeling process. It is structured into 3 parts:
* Part 1 - Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and data preparation of the **training dataset**.
* Part 2 - Data preprocessing and data preparation of the **testing dataset**.
* Part 3 - Model Fitting, Predictions and Accuracy
