A picture is worth a thousand words
Computer Vision is the science and engineering discipline concerned with making inferences about the external world
What is an image? - it is an array of pixels
The goal of computer vision is to achieve something similar to human perception

Opencv (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions for real-time computer vision.
opencv supports c, c++, python, java. c, c++ is used for optomized programming
opencv supports win, mac, linux, andriod, ios
basically cv2 supports numpy which was not supported by earlier cv versions (below 3)

basic filters:
cv2.blur(image,kernel) -> image
cv2.Laplacian(image,depth) -> image
cv2.cvtColor(image, code*) -> image
cv2.threshold(image, threshold, maxval, type*) ->image
cv2. dilate(image, kernel) -> image
cv2.erode(image,kernel) -> image
cv2.getStructuringElement(shape*,size) -> structure


cam = cv2.VideoCaprture(0) # 0 indicates the first camera, if we have 2 cameras we can use 0 and 1

height, width = image.shape


in the rectangle.py code, the if thresh[h,w] == 0, the 0 represents the black image. furthrermore, squares stores the position of the width and height
the start2.py is just optimized code for rectangle.py
