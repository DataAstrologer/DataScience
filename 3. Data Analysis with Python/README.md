**Census Data Analysis** - Census Data Analysis involves building of a predictive model based on information from the Census bureau database of 1994 in order to **predict whether a person makes over $50000** a year. Various demographic attributes about the population such as the age, education, country, etc. have been provided in the data set to help model the income distribution.

**Video Content Analysis** - VCA (Video Content Analysis) is the capability of automatically analyzing videos by extracting meaningful & relevant information, recognizing significant features (objects, motion, etc.) and detecting temporal and spatial events (activity recognition). In the above folder, a simple video of a man walking in front of a camera is analyzed. Relevant features are extracted from the video and the direction and the speed of the walking man are determined.
