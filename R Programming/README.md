# R Programming

Welcome to R. This section contains 2 folders - *Case Studies* and *Machine Learning in R*. 

* **Case Studies** - This folder contains complete **data analysis of 2 business cases** using Machine Learning in R. The first business case solves a Loan Risk Segmentation problem using Decision Trees, and the second business case solves a Telecom Churn Problem using Logistic Regression. Visit the folder to check out my work. 

* **Machine Learning in R** - This folder contains **demonstrations for using R** to implement Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Use the examples in this folder to learn R programming, to understand model building and to implement techniques to solve business problems.
