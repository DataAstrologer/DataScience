# Python 

* **Data Analysis** - This folder contains a complete data analysis of a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using statistical description and machine learning techniques. The ipython notebook with the analysis is attached as **Census_Data_Analysis**. 

* **Hyperparameter Optimization** - This folder contains a presentation on Hyperparameter Optimization methods - **Grid Search** and **Random Search**. The presentation is attached as the **Grid_Random_Comparison.rpres** file and the **Hyper-parameter Optimization.ipynb** notebook contains sample code to demonstrate the optimization methods. 

* **Machine Learning Templates** - This folder contains machine learning templates made using Python for both **supervised** and **unsupervised** algorithms. Use these templates to build and implement your machine learning models. Each algorithm is demonstrated on an example dataset.
