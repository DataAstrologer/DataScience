# Python 

Welcome to Python. This section contains 3 folders - *Case Studies*, *Hyperparameter Optimization* and *Machine Learning in Python*. 

* **Case Studies** - This folder contains complete data analysis of a **dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository** using Machine Learning in Python. Using census data, it is determined if a person makes above $50k per year based on various attributes. Visit the folder to check out my work. 

* **Hyperparameter Optimization** - This folder contains a presentation on Hyperparameter Optimization methods - **Grid Search** and **Random Search**. The presentation is attached as the *Grid_Random_Comparison.rpres* file and the *Hyper-parameter Optimization.ipynb* notebook contains sample code to demonstrate the optimization methods. 

* **Machine Learning in Python** - This folder contains **demonstrations for using Python** to implement Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Use the examples in this folder to learn about different Python libraries used for data analysis and understand model building.
