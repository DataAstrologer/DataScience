    "The data contains 5822 real customer records. Each record consists of 86 variables, containing sociodemographic data (variables 1-43) and product ownership (variables 44-86). The sociodemographic data is derived from zip codes. All customers living in areas with the same zip code have the same sociodemographic attributes. Variable 86 (Purchase) indicates whether the customer purchased a caravan insurance policy. Further information on the individual variables can be obtained at http://www.liacs.nl/~putten/library/cc2000/data.html \n",
