#Data Analysis using Python

The **Census_Data_Analysis.ipynb** file contains an end-to-end analysis of the Census Income Data using Python packages numpy, scipy, pandas and scikit learn. 

The machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines are fitted to the dataset and the accuracy for each model is compared. 

The training and testing data is inside the data folder. Furthermore, a complete description of the data is present in the UCI Mahine Learning Repository Page: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
