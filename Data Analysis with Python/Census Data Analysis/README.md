#Data Analysis using Python

* The **Census_Data_Analysis.ipynb** file contains an end-to-end analysis of the Census Income Data using Python packages **numpy**, **scipy**, **pandas** and **scikit learn**. 

* Machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines**, **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting Machines** are fitted to the dataset and the accuracy for each model is compared using various error metrics. 

* The **training data** and **testing data** is inside the UCI Dataset folder. For a complete description of the dataset, visit the UCI Machine Learning Repository link below.
